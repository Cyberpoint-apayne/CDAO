									<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
									 <p>The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) was established to enable the Military Departments and Services, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and other DoD Components, to serve on a Cross-Functional Team (CFT) to swiftly introduce new capabilities and effectively experiment with new operational concepts in support of DoD's warfighting missions and business functions with the overarching goal of accelerating the delivery of AI-enabled capabilities, scaling the Department-wide impact of AI, and synchronizing DoD AI activities to expand Joint Force advantages. A CFT is an inter-disciplinary team including military officers, acquisition officials, and technical experts.</p>
									<h4 class="top top-m-space">POSITION SUMMARY</h4>
									<p>The Chief of Capability Delivery serves in the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) as the leader for capability delivery, including all AI projects and the common infrastructure, and as an advisor to the Director of the JAIC on matters related to delivering artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled capabilities or “products” to operational users. Reporting to the JAIC Director, the individual will direct and manage multiple human-centered AI product development activities to reduce critical mission challenges, including problem scoping, development infrastructure, product engineering, test and evaluation, and operational assessment. Leveraging industry experience, the individual works collaboratively with DoD Components (e.g., Principal Staff Assistants, the Military Services and combatant commands, the Joint Staff, Research and Engineering, Industry, and academia) to develop a JAIC-wide strategy for integrating AI products into critical defense mission areas. The individual also leverages industry experience and expertise in five key areas to advance the use of AI products across the JAIC and DoD: </p>
									<p>1. Plans and directs the development, engineering, and integration of AI-based products; interprets and advises on studies, analyses and evaluations of the information systems plans, programs, projects, networks, policies, and procedures as they relate to AI. </p>
									<p>2. Serves as a widely recognized technical advisor and authority in DoD critical AI applications and computing systems design. Also works with product team members, working groups, and committees to provide senior-level technical direction, leadership, and guidance in the accomplishment of challenging tasks including the operational use of AI (both ML and non-ML); defines and initiates tasks in areas where no engineering or AI precedence exists; adjusts task direction and scope to accommodate changes in technical and schedule requirements. </p>
									<p>3. Develops and implements a DoD-wide infrastructure enabling rapid AI product delivery by providing services for data curation and secure storage, a DevOps environment providing tools and support for AI-based product development, and a production environment for fielding developed products (otherwise known as the JAIC Common Foundation). </p>
									<p>4. Initiates and develops methods to test the end-to-end system performance of developed products using operational measurements and other available test beds in order to ensure that products meet or exceed the expectations of user groups and commands. Formulates and quantifies measures of effectiveness as a basis for comparing product and system configuration alternatives. </p>
									<p>5. Helps recruit and advises on the recruiting of leading technical talent into the JAIC.</p>
									<p>Specifically, the individual will: </p>
									<p>1. Develop and communicate the JAIC’s AI “product” vision for the DoD Enterprise; establish clear goals for product-focused units (e.g., capability delivery and foundation) and individuals; and define success criteria and key metrics for assessing results achieved. The individual ensures a strong linkage between JAIC’s mission goals and objectives, the National Defense Strategy (NDS), product release criteria, etc.; work with JAIC Chief Scientist and CTO to build 1, 3, 5, and 10 year strategic roadmap for the JAIC. </p>
									<p>2. Develop, communicate, and maintain an AI product and feature roadmap that represents an accelerated, continuous release cadence; direct and advise capability team on how to best execute and manage product development to meet the roadmap; ensure that there is a lightweight, transparent version of this roadmap that can be shared internally across DoD and externally with allies, partners, industry, and academia. </p>
									<p>3. Build and track an integrated master schedule to coordinate lines of effort across the Capability Delivery, Infrastructure, and Test &amp; Evaluation Teams; track progress and identify critical path risks for cross-team execution. </p>
									<p>4. Participate in reviews conducted by the Capability Delivery, Infrastructure, and Test &amp; Evaluation Teams. Ensure that systems engineering, technical engineering, and program management best practices and lessons learned are being observed. Facilitate communications and integration across the Capability Delivery, Infrastructure, and Test &amp; Evaluation Teams.</p>
									<p>5. Work with each NMI/CMI Chief/leads to build a strategic program plan for the delivery of prioritized and increasing user-focused capabilities via multiple agile sprints; direct capability delivery team to discover AI product requirements through continuous user engagement and evolved through prototyping. </p>
									<p>6. Work with the T&amp;E Team to identify/develop measures of effectiveness and measures of performance for AI products; direct the development and use of Intended Use Statements and test and evaluation plans throughout each system’s lifecycle; ensure that execution plans include measureable, operationally meaningful outcomes which can inform the conduct of operational assessments of deployed technologies </p>
									<p>7. Work with Capability Delivery and Infrastructure Teams to build a roadmap for near-term infrastructure requirements and long-range infrastructure goals that serve DoD AI enterprise requirements; track iterative improvement of the JAIC Common Foundation (JCF) Infrastructure as product delivery progresses; ensure that infrastructure is continuously adapting and expanding to meet product development requirements. </p>
									<p>8. Provide technology and product leadership for AI-focused public-private partnerships and open missions with academia and industry; focus on aligning efforts, jointly identifying, analyzing, and accelerating the delivery of promising near-term capabilities, and identifying opportunities for partnership in the areas of AI product or technology; ensure a strong technical understanding across the DoD Enterprise regarding AI products, to include data flows, infrastructure, and architectures involved in building and delivering the products to end users. </p>
									<p>9. Coordinate regularly with industry, academia, and research and development leaders in government, as authorized and appropriate, to identify, analyze, and further near-term capabilities. </p>
									<p>10. Represent the JAIC as a senior advisor on National Mission Initiatives (NMI) and Component Mission Initiatives (CMI), infrastructure, test and evaluation, and other matters of national and defense AI policy, including technology, product, or other matters in JAIC portfolio such as ethics and safety, to DoD Senior leaders. </p>
									<p>11. Advise the Director of the JAIC on recruiting leading AI/technology talent into the DoD civilian, uniformed, and contractor workforce; provide the Director of the JAIC with recommended courses of action (COA) with respect to all corresponding, AI-focused hiring actions, personnel realignments, etc. affecting product delivery. </p>
